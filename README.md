## Overview

This GitHub repository contains a Python script that utilizes the OpenCV library for real-time face detection in a video stream. The Haar Cascade Classifier is employed to identify frontal faces within each frame of the specified video. Detected faces are highlighted with rectangles, and the processed video is displayed in a window.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have OpenCV installed in your Python environment. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage
**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-opencv.git
cd face-detection-opencv
```
**2. Run the Script**
```bash
python face_detection.py
```
**3. Quit the application**

Press `q` or `Q` key to exit the code.
